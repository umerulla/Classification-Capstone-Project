# Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction
**Project Summary:**

In this classification project for an insurance company, we aim to predict customer interest in vehicle insurance based on relevant features such as age, driving license status, vehicle details, and more. The project involves thorough data exploration, handling null and duplicate values, and extracting key insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA). Subsequent steps include preprocessing, feature engineering, addressing class imbalance, and fitting various machine learning models to determine the most effective predictor for customer interest in vehicle insurance.

This is an Classification project in which the dataset has information on the insuarance, vehicle details and some customer information by which we have to predict whether the customer is intrested in vehicle insuarance or not. We will analyze the data, find key insights by visualization and fit the best possible model for prediction

## Conclusion
**Key Findings:**
1. The dataset is skewed towards male customers, constituting 54.1%, with a notable gap in responses from female customers. The company should target strategies to engage more with female customers.
2. Nearly all customers (99.8%) possess a driving license, presenting a significant opportunity for the company to promote vehicle insurance.
3. Age group analysis reveals that customers aged 20-32 have a lower response rate compared to those aged 33-55. Strategic marketing efforts should prioritize the younger demographic.
4. Vehicles aged 1-2 years old garner the highest response, while those less than a year old show lower interest. Collaborations with dealers could enhance insurance sales for newer vehicles.
5. Customers with damaged vehicles exhibit the highest response rates, indicating a potential focus area for marketing and awareness campaigns.
6. Premium payments span a wide range, from 5000 to over 100,000, suggesting diverse customer segments with varying insurance needs.

**Suggestions:**

1. Prioritize marketing efforts towards female customers to balance gender response rates.
2. Tailor marketing strategies to engage and educate customers aged 20-32, the largest age group with comparatively lower response rates.
3. Collaborate with dealers to tap into the potential of customers with vehicles less than a year old, highlighting the benefits of additional insurance coverage.
4. Increase awareness among customers whose vehicles have not been damaged, emphasizing the advantages of proactive insurance coverage.
5. Leverage insights from premium payment analysis to customize offerings for different customer segments, ensuring competitive pricing and value-added services.
