# Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction
**Project Summary:**

In this classification project for an insurance company, we aim to predict customer interest in vehicle insurance based on relevant features such as age, driving license status, vehicle details, and more. The project involves thorough data exploration, handling null and duplicate values, and extracting key insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA). Subsequent steps include preprocessing, feature engineering, addressing class imbalance, and fitting various machine learning models to determine the most effective predictor for customer interest in vehicle insurance.
